## About
I embarked on my journey as a Flutter developer under the guidance of my professor, working on a brain tumor detection application. This project utilized the tflite_flutter package with a pre-trained model, laying the foundation for my expertise in machine learning integration.

My subsequent internship at Code Cue Solutions Pvt. Ltd. proved instrumental in honing my skills. I developed multiple applications, including Podmaps and Humstaffing, which showcased my proficiency in managing complex projects. Through these experiences, I mastered state management, dual-panel development for user and organization sides, API integration, GitHub version control, and Firebase integration.

As I continued to grow, I took on the role of Flutter Team Lead in my professor's organization. This leadership position allowed me to mentor junior developers and refine my project management skills. Later, I expanded my technical expertise to the MERN stack at Ranking Grow Pvt. Ltd., further solidifying my position as a versatile developer.

Currently, I serve as a Computer Science teacher at Jinnah Jame School and College in Haripur. This role enables me to share my knowledge and experience with the next generation of developers, inspiring them to pursue careers in technology.

Throughout my journey, I've learned the importance of adaptability, teamwork, and continuous learning. My diverse experiences have equipped me with a unique blend of technical and interpersonal skills, allowing me to excel in both development and educational settings.
